#Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished
#in x units of time, he finishes it in mâˆ—x units of time. But there is
#always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max d units of time.
#Given x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.

#Input:
#First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
#Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers x,m,d.
